            After thoroughly researching this topic and viewing arguments from both sides, I really think that it would be in everyone's best interest if we can integrate this technology into society. This is reflected in the eagerness of some institutions to implement this technology within their structures. In police enforcement the potential amount of crime that can be prevented by catching criminal individuals is massive and would be a major benefit to their respective communities. In saying that it also showed me the massive potential for misuse and abuse if not implemented correctly. The arguments regarding its invasion of privacy rights and potential use by law enforcement institutions to target people on certain characteristics is not unfounded. As mentioned in the other pages of the website, there can be inaccuracies when it comes to identifying people of different ethnicities, which can possibly lead to perpetuation of stereotypes and discrimination. In America for example it was noted that facial recognition systems were more likely to mis-identify or fail to identify African American citizens than any other race. This can lead to unjust situations and misrepresentation of arrests made based on the technology that is being used. For me facial recognition has a long way to go and lots of things need to be carefully considered if we want society to enjoy the potential benefits that this technology has to offer.

            The ethical issues that arise with the use of facial recognition are an invasion of people's private lives and recording them without their permission or knowledge and saving that information for other users, isn't allowed but if facial recognition is to be utilized then this blatant invasion would just be ignored, or every single person would have to agree to it being used on them. Accessibility of the data (for example Google reverse image search) Makes it quite easy to find images about people that they have put online as well Just being in the back of someone else’s photo. this makes the ethics of Accessibility to this type of program be used by bad actors to stalk or harass individuals without needing to know much about technology. However, every single person of the given population comes together and agrees on using something with that much power is highly unlikely. This is clearly proven in the world when the Covid pandemic hit, and its governments found it so hard to rally the people of their country together and work towards one goal. Most governments had to completely give up on their policies and rules regarding this pandemic because there was backlash and riots starting from the public.  Within the government having the ability to monitor and rank people (Liang et al., 2018) it is so important that this power is never unchecked and always monitored by a third party. the ability for the software to become out of control would happen fast. If such influential technology were to become racist on its own or through misuse it would bring up a lot of ethical issues as the wrong people could end up with punishments that they are very undeserving of because they look like someone. There are many concerns regarding this technology, and it still has a lot of bugs to work through before it could even be operating full time in public places and with law enforcement agencies, especially with law enforcement agencies because there will have to be a way to monitor the people who have access to this technology otherwise there will be people who can abuse and misuse it. Such as customer service industry will need to have checks and balances for the ability to use facial recognition software on their customers to discourage the business to manipulate their customers and their employees to buy more when the software detects Attributes of the person so they can encourage them to buy more or for the employees to work longer hours as well as detect if they are paying attention to their job
