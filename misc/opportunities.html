<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p>With the rapid development of facial recognition technology society is presented with a multitude of opportunities in many aspects of life. The most obvious of which is within police/military sectors. The application of facial recognition AI in western countries thus far has been on a small scale. Notably the Tampa police force tested one such software named Faceit for one year. The results were overall positive, as even though there were no arrests made, it was noted that the integration of the facial recognition software with their cameras did allow them to keep a watchful eye over general activities. They also found that the reliability of the software has steadily increased since 1993. In China where it is widespread and integrated within their systems it shows one of the most obvious benefits that this technology can have. A criminal wanted for economic crimes was caught out by one of the facial recognition cameras on site at a concert with around 60, 000 people (Amy, 2018). It could also be used on a much smaller scale, notifying retail owners when repeat offenders enter their store, allowing them time to react appropriately and notify local authorities. As we can see, the proper implementation of this software into public spaces provides the very real opportunity to increase the reactivity of the police force and their effectiveness in carrying out investigations on unsolved cases. In this regard it would also not be too difficult to have this software be able to locate missing peoples as well. It was also used to great effect by the Mexican government to stop duplicate voters (Carlson et al., 2019). This technology not only has benefits for other sectors of life as well such as the medical field. As facial recognition technology uses even the most minute of details to identify a person, it can be used to identify more subtle morphologies of genetic disorders and other diseases that may not be as visible to the human eye of clinicians, minimising effects of human error, and allowing physicians to respond quickly and efficiently (Martinez-Martin, 2019). Some institutions, such as banks already use facial recognition to be able to identify their customers for security purposes and even in our day to day life users use facial scanning technology to get access into their smart devices. Some cafes are already utilizing facial recognition technology so they can identify customers, recurring and new as well as their orders (Bolger, 2018). This can enhance the customer-business relationship allowing for more fluid transactions. While businesses also have begun to adopt it as a way for their workers to clock in and out, ensuring working hours are precisely calculated, and the movement of their employees is monitored. A casino in Australia, Australia's Crown Casino utilizes the facial recognition for security reasons but even more impressively to identify  problem gamblers who asked to be barred from venues recognising their own addiction and having the business help them overcome it and not spend their money (Blaszczynski et al., 2020). This alleviates the pressure on the workers to identify them and is another prime example of how the relationship between customer and business can be enhanced by the use of this technology. Businesses can also use this facial recognition, not only for recognising people but detecting expressions as well, allowing it to be used to determine how a user feels towards certain products/services and allow them to adapt to give the customer the product that they are looking for. There are many more avenues for the technology of facial recognition AI to be a benefit to society for the general public and opportunities will only continue to rise as the technology is further developed and expanded on.</p>
