<h1>Facial Recognition AI in public spaces.</h1>


</ul><h5><p>What is Facial recognition AI?<p></h5>
     <p>Facial recognition is actually a branch of research which focuses on building software that is able to analyze the similarities of peoples faces from videos and images. Facial recognition works by transforming the image of the person's face into a numerical expression which is called a template. The template is compared to the other templates in the database to determine whose face is in the image. If their face is already in the database that is being scanned.(Crumpler & Lewis, 2021).</p>

    <h5><p>Why did we choose this tpoic?<p></h5>
    <p>
        The reason we chose Facial Recognition in public places is because we believe that if this technology was used respectively for the public and only used for the safety of individuals it could be very useful in the right places, which could help save multiple lives depending on the scenario. Interpol is a great example to prove this as they have been using facial recognition software since 2016 and have reported that an upward of 1500 terrorists, criminals, fugitives, persons of interest etc have been identified through the use of facial recognition.(Facial Recognition, 2017). This software does not have to save lives to be useful either, the functionality of this software could help detect identity fraud when it comes to voting, or people losing their money etc. Banks have already started implementing the use of facial recognition through phones and cameras, however the use of this software through phones is more aimed towards user accessibility and functionality as this allows user to sign in without the use of their password and their face can only unlock their account if they so choose to, but this also shows how this technology can be used in many ways to benefit society. These uses are the reason we have decided that this topic was important enough to talk about at all.</p>
    <p>
        Facial recognition is very versatile and can be used in many different ways. We chose to  go into more depth about the uses of the technology in terms of its usage by law enforcement and its applicability in private sectors of society. Throughout the entirety of this webpage we will talk about the many uses of facial recognition. Like how Interpol has been implementing it with their security and how banks are using it to identify their customers for security purposes and the protection of the people in the bank at any given time. (Facial Recognition, 2017). But we won't only be talking about the opportunities presented by this technology, we will also be discussing the risks that show itself as we test and use this technology, such as the threat of having facial recognition software intrude on people's privacy and a threat to their human rights. The accuracy of the facial recognition technology also has to be taken into account as not every person utilising this technology will be using the same type of software and deciding on which ones to validate and trust. And we have to consider whether or not the software itself could become racist, such as some of the facial recognition technology out now, where some of them  have already shown some errors regarding the different colours of the people present in the data and the inconsistencies of data for each demographic. The choices that could be made by law enforcement and banks if they are able to use this technology, because like the justice system there will be flaws and ways to abuse Facial recognition if it is used in such a way.
