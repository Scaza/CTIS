<h1>CTiS: Impact of Technology Site</h1>


</ul><p>The application of facial recognition AI thus far has been on a small scale. 
        Notably the Tampa police force tested one such software named Faceit for one year. 
        The results were overall positive, as even though there were no arrests made, the integration of the facial recognition software with their cameras did allow them to keep a watchful eye over general activities. 
        They also found that the reliability of the software has steadily increased since 1993 (“US Federal Trade Commission Workshop on Privacy Implications of Facial Recognition,” 2011). 
        It has the potential to increase the reactivity of the police force and their effectiveness in carrying out investigations on unsolved cases. 
        It was also used to great effect by the Mexican government to stop duplicate voters (Facial Recognition Technology and Ethics, 2019). </p>

<p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip;
It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.  The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>
